## Introduction
This repository contains the code of the paper [Adversarial Metric Attack for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10650). It proposes adversarial metric attack, a parallel methodology to the existing adversarial classification attack. Adversarial metric attack can be used to attack metric-based systems like person re-identification and generate adversarial examples accordingly.
